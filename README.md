# Elixir Flo-time

Elixir Flotime is a low-code solution used to build 'flo pipelines' built on top of Elixir GenStage. Users without any coding knowledge can quickly deploy business logic to a prod environment. At the same time, more advanced users have access to a traditional software stack with an SDK. Similar product inspirations: Apache Airflow, Snaplogic, Chronicle SOAR, Phantom SOAR, and Node-Red. 

**Feature Set:**
- A low-code web gui builder
- Multi tenancy environments
- Liveview monitor and report dashboards
- Pipeline backpressure + configurable concurrency 
- Subflo pipelines within pipelines
- Developer SDK for custom stages
- All changes / updates tracked through git repository
